# Formalisation of Kloosterman sums and its related Character sums

This is the Mary Lister McCammon Fellowship for summer 2023, supervised by Prof. Kevin Buzzard. 
We provide the formalisation of the following main results in this repository : 
1. The definition of Kloosterman sum and its related elementary lemmas
2. The proof for the formula generic character sum $\sum _ x \chi (x) \psi (x)$ for multiplicative character $\chi$ and additive character $\psi$ for the even case when the g

It also contains the incomplete formalisation for the case when . But I hit the time limit . 
If we specify 
1. The definition


. If I miss Lean a lot, I might come back to it again and complete the case 

The general proof follows the
